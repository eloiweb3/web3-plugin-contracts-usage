### Summary

This repo shows how to use the ```web3-plugin-contracts``` from [Web3js plugins](https://web3js.org/plugins).

The Contracts Plugin simplifies the process of interacting with Solidity-based smart contracts. It tackles the challenge of efficient contract interaction by removing the necessity to store and manage contract instances and ABIs. As a result, it greatly improves the developer experience and project functionality by streamlining contract interactions, facilitating smoother integration with external contracts, and ultimately boosting overall project efficiency.
